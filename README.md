Selenium | Java | TestNG | Maven | Data Driven Framework

1. Project Setup:
   - Create a Maven project in your preferred IDE.
   - Add dependencies for Selenium WebDriver and TestNG in the `pom.xml` file.

2. Framework Structure:
   - Organize project into packages (e.g., Pages, Tests, Utilities).
   - Choose a design pattern (e.g., Page Object Model).

3. Page Objects:
   - Create classes for each web page.
   - Define methods to interact with page elements.

4. TestNG Integration:
   - Write test classes and methods annotated with TestNG annotations (e.g., `@Test`).
   - Utilize TestNG features like data providers for data-driven testing.

5. Driver Management:
   - Use WebDriverManager for dynamic driver setup.
   - Configure browser options and capabilities dynamically.

6. Test Data Management:
   - Integrate external data sources for test data (e.g., Excel, CSV).
   - Implement data-driven testing for versatile test scenarios.

7. Reporting and Logging:
   - Set up logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j) for detailed logs.
   - Generate HTML reports for test results (e.g., ExtentReports).

8. Continuous Integration:
   - Integrate with CI tools (e.g., Jenkins) for automated test execution.

9. Version Control:
   - Utilize Git for version control and collaboration.
